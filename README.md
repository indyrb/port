## Running

Automatically set up as much as possible:

    bin/setup

Now you should be able to run the game!

    bin/port

There are a few command line options for things like fullscreen mode, run the
application with --help to see the full list.

Now click and drag a plane to draw a path to a safe landing.

In game keys:

    P   Pause
    V   Send a vehicle

    E   Toggle extras(clouds and smoke)
    S   Toggle sound
    M   Toggle music

    D   Debug

## Credits

We took some sounds and images from places we probably shouldn't have, we can't remember where that was.
